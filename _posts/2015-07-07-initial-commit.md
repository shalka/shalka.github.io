Ah! I've joined the blagosphere! I should probably explain what this blog is about before I actually start posting things.

Rather than storing notes and pictures of 3d-printed objects in [Evernote][evernote] (which don't get me wrong, Evernote is awesome), I think I'd like to share them more publicly. Hence, this blog (shameless plug: powered by [Jekyll][jekyll] and built in a few hours, so bear with me while I tinker with the styling).

Since I also write software (both in my spare time and professionally), I'll probably start writing about some of my side projects and work projects, too.
